## Repo for [Let's Build: Instagram with Rails (TDD) - Part 1](http://www.devwalks.com/lets-build-instagram-test-driven-with-ruby-on-rails-part-1/)

This will continue to be used throughout the guide so refer to the commits when wanting
to go back in time for different stages.  Part 1 is a bit wonky due to dodgy git usage.  
It should be ok from now on :).
